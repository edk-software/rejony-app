Getting around
==============

In order to use Cantiga, you need to have an account. The welcome screen to the system shows nothing more than just a login screen:

The bottom bar allows choosing the current language. Under the form, there are two links for creating a new account and recovering the lost password. The default credentials available after the installation are:

 * login: **administrator**
 * password: **Admin56789**
 
Navigation
----------

After logging in, the user can see a dashboard:

Let's take a look at the user interface of Cantiga.

 * To the left, there is a **workspace menu**. You can use it to access workspace-specific pages.
 * In the top-left corner, you see the logo and the application name. The icon next to it shows and hides the menu.
 * At the top, you can see the **top bar**, with the workspace selector, profile information and help icon.
 * At the bottom, you can see the footer.
 * The central part of the screen displays the content.

In Cantiga, everything happens within a workspace. As we know from the introduction chapters, each place has its own workspace. There are also two special workspaces:

 * *User workspace* allows the users to manage their profiles,
 * *Admin workspace* allows the administrators to configure and manage Cantiga system.

After logging in, everyone lands in their user workspace. The name of the workspace is shown under the logo, and its type is marked by the color of the top bar:

 * green color: user workspace,
 * red color: admin workspace,
 * blue color: project workspace,
 * white color: group workspace,
 * purple color: area workspace.

Switching between workspaces
----------------------------

To switch between workspaces, use the *workspace selector*. It can be found on the *top bar* and it is represented by an icon of two opposing arrows and the name of the current workspace. Click on it to expand the list of available workspaces and places. You can use it to navigate between places, and your user workspace. In addition, the links to the places you are a member of are shown on the user dashboard.

Accessing help
