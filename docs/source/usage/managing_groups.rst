Creating groups
===============

Project members can define new groups in the project. To access the group management panel:

1. go to the *project workspace*,
2. expand **Data** section from the *workspace menu*,
3. select **Groups**.

After creating a group, it is possible to invite group leaders by opening the group details, clicking **Manage** button at the top of the page, and selecting **Members**. To read more about inviting people to places, see :ref:`inviting_people`.

Group categories
----------------

To ease the management of the big number of groups, you can define group categories. Each group can belong to a single category, and the category can be used in some list filters: for example, you can find the areas assigned to all the groups in the specified category.
