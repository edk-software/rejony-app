Membership
==========

Each user of Cantiga has its own account and profile. He or she can be a member of multiple places, and get access to their workspaces. Everyone who wants to get access to Cantiga, must create an account. However, to be able to do anything useful except customizing their profile, the user must be *invited* to some place. Invitations are sent by the managers of the given place.

Working on a project is about good communication, and usually, the members of the same place must have contact one to another. Hence, accepting the invitation requires providing some contact information for other members (e-mail, and telephone). The visibility of the contact data is limited. Although everyone who is a member of some place associated with certain project, can see your profile, he or she will not see your contact data. The detailed visibility rules are described in the later part of this manual.
