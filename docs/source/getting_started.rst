Getting started
===============

Thank you for choosing Cantiga! It is a membership management platform for non-profit organizations that helps them running their projects. Cantiga allows the organizations to track the project progress, organize volunteers and provide services for them, such as on-line courses, or a place for discussions. A special area of interest are geographically distributed projects, where the volunteers work in multiple cities, provinces or countries, and the role of the organization is supervising them.

Cantiga started as a membership management system for one of the projects held by WIO and WIOSNA Associations, that gathers more than 30 000 people every year in Poland and neighbor countries. It allowed gaining experience with creating a management platform for such organizations, and test many concepts and approaches in practice. Since the beginning, the system was designed to be available for public to everyone who wants to run such projects and needs a management solution for them.

Before we start using Cantiga, we'll first get familiar with some concepts behind it.
