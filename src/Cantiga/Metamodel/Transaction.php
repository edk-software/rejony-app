/**
 * In PHP, the flow is very simple. We prepare to run the action, we run the action, we finalize.
 * Advanced transactional management, known i.e. from Java is too complex (I know, what I'm saying,
 * because I'm a professional Java programmer). Here the entire action can run within a single
 * transaction that is rolled back if something goes wrong.
 * 
 * <p>The main use case is situation, where we call a nested block of code that also requests a
 * transaction. The service does nothing, if the transaction is already opened, and finalizes it
 * at the very end.
